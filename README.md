## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

`GraphQL` application powered by `FastAPI` and `Strawberry`. Similarly to `Shulker Box`, this service uses `Beanie` as the ORM in front of MongoDB. The approach is a little different here, since the app does not expose a create endpoint, but instead it consumes events from the other microservices and creates the notifications.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get started you need to have `Docker` installed and optionally `Poetry`, if you want to have virtual environment locally. All the needed commands are available via `Makefile`.

### Installing

First, build the images.

```bash
make build
```

Then, you can just start the containers.

```bash
make up
```

After that, you should be able to see the output from the `FastAPI` server. It will be running on port `8004`, so you can access the documentation via `http://localhost:8004/api/docs`.

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

There are also few useful commands to help manage the project.

If you have `Poetry` installed, you can run below command to have all the dependencies installed locally.

```bash
make install
```

In case you want to avoid installing anything locally, you can enter server container and run other commands from there.

```bash
make enter
```

## üîß Development <a name = "development"></a>

To make development smoother, this project supports `pre-commit` hooks for linting and code formatting along with `pytest` for testing. All the configs can be found in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `pyproject.toml` files.

To install the hooks, run the following command.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Then you can use the following to run the hooks.

```bash
make lint
```

There is also a command for running tests.

```bash
make test
```

`pytest` is configured to clean the database after every test. Tests are also using different sessions to have a clean separation. You can check more fixtures in the `conftest.py` file, or the general configuration in the `pytest.ini` section.
